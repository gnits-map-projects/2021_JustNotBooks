User Manual
About:
Every academic year, a lot of things gets exchanged among students within colleges and schools. This approach of borrowing items from their fellow students becomes a problem when the required item is not available within the college or it may be in use. Issues of these traditional methods can be resolved using a common platform among students from different colleges and schools. This common platform is a free-to-use website for student-to-student online uploaded and borrowed or brought items.
This website operates as an inter-college online classifieds market place for used items of the students including electronic calculators, drafters, aprons etc., It is accessible through the internet. The description of the items uploaded by the lender gives borrowers a clear idea about the item. These items are categorized based on buy, borrow or donate and can be accessed easily. Borrower can contact the lender privately after requesting an item. All the irrelevant activities are controlled by the admin. This will reduce the physical efforts of students meeting different individuals in the college.
